# kolkata-metro-viewer
Kolkata Metro Route Viewer is a simple and interactive Streamlit web app designed to help users visualize all Kolkata Metro lines and find the best route between any two stations. The app displays all active metro lines—Blue, Green, Purple, and Orange—on a neon-themed map, making navigation visually appealing and intuitive. Users can select any two metro stations from dropdown menus, and the app will highlight the shortest route between them with a green line. It also calculates and displays the total distance in kilometers, the estimated travel time based on an average metro speed of 30 km/h, and suggests interchange stations when no direct line exists between the source and destination. Built using Python libraries like Streamlit, Pydeck, and Haversine, this app is both lightweight and efficient, requiring no external map APIs or data downloads. Whether you're a daily commuter or just exploring the city, the Kolkata Metro Route Viewer makes route planning easy and visually engaging. Future improvements could include real-time train schedules, fare estimates, and integrated multi-mode travel options. You can access the full project and source code on GitHub and try the app live through Streamlit sharing.
